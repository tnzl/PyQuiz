## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo (if you haven't already done so).
2. Clone it to your computer. You can do it using `git clone url_name`.
3. When you're ready to work on an issue, be sure you're on the **master** branch(Check using `git branch`). From there, create a separate branch. You can do this using `git checkout -b branch_name` where branch_name (e.g. issue_32) is the name of a new branch that you create.
4. Make your changes. Save the file. Go to the command line and do `git add file_name` to add it to the staging area.
5. Commit your changes. Do this using `git commit -m "comment about the changes made"`.
6. Push the working branch (e.g. issue_32) to your remote fork. This is done using `git push origin branch_name`.
7. Make the pull request (on the [upstream **master** branch](https://github.com/abhijitnathwani/PyQuiz/tree/master))
    * Do not merge it with the master branch on your fork. That would result in multiple, or unrelated patches being included in a single PR.
8. If any further changes need to be made, comments will be made on the pull request.


If you're unsure of some details while you're making edits, you can comment on the issue, or drop an email at abhijit.nathwani@gmail.com .

It's possible to work on two or more different patches (and therefore multiple branches) at one time, but it's recommended that beginners only work on one patch at a time.
